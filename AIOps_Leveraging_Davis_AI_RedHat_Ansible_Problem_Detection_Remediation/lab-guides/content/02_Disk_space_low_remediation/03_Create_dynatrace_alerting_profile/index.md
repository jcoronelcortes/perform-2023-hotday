## Create Dynatrace Alerting Profile

As a second step, you will create a **Dynatrace Problem alerting profile** to link the alerts generated by the previous configuration (step 2) to a **Dynatrace problem notification\*** (step 4). This profile allows us to filter/aggregate multiple alert types into a single group that we can use later on in the auto-remediation workflow.

1. Get into Dynatrace > Settings > Alerting > Problem alerting profiles
1. Create a new item with the name: `disk-alert`
1. Under **Event filters** click on add event filter and use the `Predefined` option as the event source.
1. Under **Filter problems by a Dynatrace event type** search for **Low disk space**.
1. Save your changes.
