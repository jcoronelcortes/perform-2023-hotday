## Dynatrace detection of the memory leak
1. Go to your Dynatrace environment.
2. Navigate to the JVM on which the memory leak was triggered. To do that, go to **Technologies and processes** and type in `backend` for the name in the filter menu. You will see one option, an Apache Tomcat process group `com.dynatrace.easytravel.business.backend.jar easytravel-*-x*`. Click on that process group.<BR><BR>

3. Click in to the individual process, `com.dynatrace.easytravel.business.backend.jar easytravel-*-x*`.<BR><BR>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212930113-110cb5a5-a343-49b1-b5f7-aa8ac65289a4.png)
4. Look at the initial memory leak's metrics by clicking the **JVM Metrics** tab. Notice that, during the memory leak, the JVM suspension, heap memory, and others will increase, as seen below. Eventually, these will increase to the point where the JVM will become unresponsive. At that point, we will want Dynatrace to auto-remediate by restarting the JVM. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212931433-0dd4a7fb-2f87-4293-a12b-12121d81c489.png)
5. Dynatrace's AI, DAVIS, will detect metric anomalies related to the memory leak (e.g. increased JVM suspension). To see the problem card, go to **Problems** on the left-hand side. If your time selector is set to the **Last 2 hours** (check upper right-hand corner), then you should see the memory leak on the `com.dynatrace.easytravel.business.backend.jar easytravel-*-x*` JVM as a `Memory resources exhausted` problem. <BR><BR>

 6. When you drill into the `Memory resources exhausted` problem, you will notice the metric anomalies observed by DAVIS and **Comments** related to the problem. In the comments section, Dynatrace describes all events *related to the problem's life cycle*, as well as any comments manually entered by the user. Here, you will see that AWX has responded to the memory leak. In doing so, it sent a comment to this problem over the Dynatrace API at the beginning of the job.<BR><BR>

 7. To remediate, AWX has determined the IP address of the host underlying the JVM with the memory. It then restarts EasyTravel and waits for EasyTravel to come up successfully (returning a response code of `HTTP 200`). After successfully initializing, AWX then sends a final comment to the problem over the Dynatrace API.
 8. The problem will then appear as closed in Dynatrace, thereby ending its lifecycle.
