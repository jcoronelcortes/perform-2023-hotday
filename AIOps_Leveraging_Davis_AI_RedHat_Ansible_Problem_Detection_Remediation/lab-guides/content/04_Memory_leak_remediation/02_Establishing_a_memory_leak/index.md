## Establishing a memory leak
1. From your ACE dashboard launch page (i.e., `http://dashboard.XX.YY.ZZ.AA.nip.io/`), navigate to the **EasyTravel Launcher** tab. Launch the website.
2. Start EasyTravel by navigating to **UEM > Standard**. Give EasyTravel a couple of minutes to initialize. <BR><BR>

3. Confirm EasyTravel is running in your Dynatrace environment. To do that, go back to your ACE dashboard page (it should be on another tab), and then click the **Dynatrace** tab. There will be a hyperlink to your Dynatrace tenant, seen below. Using another tab, navigate to that hyperlink. After the Dynatrace tenant appears, select **Smartscape topology** under **Observe and explore** on the left-hand navbar. Then pick the EasyTravel management zone - a global filter - by selecting the filter icon in the upper right-hand corner and clicking `EasyTravel Classic`. You should have approximately 20 services in the vertical topology mapping for `EasyTravel Classic`. If so, EasyTravel is running successfully and is monitored by Dynatrace! <BR><BR> *Navigate to Dynatrace* ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212740663-81176a5b-7571-4472-95ac-dea18668ab39.png) <BR><BR>*Select management zone* ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212741347-6144f9ba-aea3-42fc-9471-529a5d5c9fc2.png)
4. Return to the ACE dashboard launch page (on another tab). From here, select **AWX**, the open-source version of Ansible. ACE-BOX has provisioned AWX for you behind the scenes. Navigate to the AWX instance, and login with your credentials (they should be `dynatrace` and `dynatrace`). 
5. Select **Templates** on the right-hand side. Go to the **Trigger Memory Leak on Backend** template. <BR><BR> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212744253-04a235cd-3cee-4c96-b090-5467f187574a.png)
6. Launch the memory leak template by clicking **Launch**. <BR><BR> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212744707-7523fc28-13b1-4bd5-bd77-e748093c4f2d.png)
7. Analyze the output of the job. A successful job should take 5 to 30 s to complete, as seen below. <BR><BR>![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212744873-6b83eb62-b101-45d5-aad4-26724f302599.png)
8. Return to the EasyTravel administration page (it should be on your other tab). Enable the **Problem Patterns** tab by clicking the **Settings** gear in the upper right corner. Select **Show Problem Patterns**. <BR><BR> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48868648/212738990-74dc193b-9075-4794-8cd3-4fae37686b95.png)
9. Click **Problem Patterns**, and validate that the `MediumMemoryLeak` option has been checked. This was set by the AWX job. <BR><BR>
