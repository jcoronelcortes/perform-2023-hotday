## Check Dynatrace monitoring

Now that we know the application is running, we need to switch over to Dynatrace and see if the easytrade application is being monitored.

#### Areas in Dynatrace to view from the left navigation menu

- Navigate to Infrastructure - Hosts

```bash
Action: Look at the "Hosts" page
```
- Navigate to Infrastructure - Technologies and processes

```bash
Action: Look at the "Technologies and processes" page
```
- Navigate to Application & Microservices - Services

```bash
Action: Look at the "Services" page
Action: Make sure you see "easyTradePricingService" services

```
