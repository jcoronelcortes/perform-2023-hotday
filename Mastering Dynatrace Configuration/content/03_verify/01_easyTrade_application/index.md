```

- If you see a Login page it is working properly. You can register a fake account to further test the easytrade application. 

```bash
Action: Register a fake account - use your broswer back button after it registers
Action: Login using your fake account
Action: Click on menu item Dashboard
Action: Click on menu item Deposit Funds
Action: Click on menu item Withdraw Funds
Action: Click on menu item Trade
```

**FYI** - None of the fields are validated so you can type anything you want for your account details, once you have registered click the browser back button to return to the Login page, there is not a login button on the registration page.
