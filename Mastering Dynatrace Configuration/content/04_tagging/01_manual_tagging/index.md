## Manual Tags

To get started with this tagging module you first need to find the easytrade entities in Dynatrace.

Add a manual tag to the easytrade entities, you can use any manual tag you want, if you want you can use your first or last name to make it simple. The actions will refer to your **tag key**, replace that with whatever you decide.
