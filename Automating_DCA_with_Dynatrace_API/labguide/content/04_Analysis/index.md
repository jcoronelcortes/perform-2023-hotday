## Telling a Compelling Story 

Dynatrace collects a vast quantity of data about your applications. How can you use that to tell a compelling story?
Dynatrace Dashboards are a great way to create a narrative with up to date information. Did you know you can create them with the API?
Say you have a website and Dynatrace is telling you that it's not performing optimally. How can you improve it? And more importantly, how can
you track that it is, in fact improved by your changes in a way everyone can understand. In this section we will be taking you through how to create Dynatrace Dashboards through the API and use the Events API to add your custom metrics so you can tell a compelling story and turn the vast amount of data Dynatrace collects into value for your company.

In this lesson we will be using a <a href="https://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/coach/" target="_blank">node package called webcoach</a>  to give us some actionable recommendations on improving the performance of your Website to improve customer retention and satisfaction. We will be using this data to create a website improvement recommendation dashboard. When we combine the Coach data with Dynatrace, we can create a baseline and use live Dynatrace Synthetic monitoring to track how the improvements affect customer experience.Â
